# 📌 Student Depression Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📂 Dataset Overview
This dataset contains information related to **student depression levels**, including various **demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors** that may influence mental health. The objective of this analysis is to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors contributing to student depression.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
### 1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Loaded the dataset** and checked for missing/null values.
- Removed any irrelevant columns if necessary.
- Converted categorical variables into appropriate formats.

### 2️⃣ **Statistical Summary**
- Used `.describe()` to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
- Analyzed the presence of outliers and inconsistencies in the data.

### 3️⃣ **Data Visualization**
#### 📊 **Depression Risk Analysis**
- **Depression levels by gender**: Bar plot showing the distribution of depression among male and female students.
- **Depression levels by academic performance**: Analyzed the correlation between grades and depression risk.
- **Impact of physical activity on mental health**: Explored whether exercise habits affect depression levels.
- **Social factors and depression**: Studied the effect of family background, social support, and loneliness.

#### 📉 **Feature Distributions**
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of **age, study hours, sleep duration**, and other key features.
- Boxplots to detect outliers in numerical features like **stress levels and screen time**.

#### 🔗 **Correlation Analysis**
- Heatmap to identify relationships between **stress levels, academic performance, sleep patterns, and depression risk**.
- Pair plots for key variables to understand relationships visually.

## 🎯 Key Insights
- **Higher stress levels and poor sleep habits** showed a strong correlation with increased depression risk.
- **Social isolation** and lack of physical activity were common among students experiencing depression.
- **Academic pressure** plays a crucial role in student mental health, with high achievers also experiencing anxiety.
- **Outliers in physical activity data** suggest further validation may be needed.
